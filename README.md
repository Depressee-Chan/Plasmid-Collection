# DChan Plasmids
This is a library of various plasmids I've designed over time. The majority of them are plant/agrobacterium-based however, there are a few that aren't so should anyone want to try to use them, I suggest thoroughly reading the ```README.md``` file that is the corresponding folder before attempting to use the plasmids.

## How to use
In this repository there are multiple folders, each correspond with a plasmid. Inside those folders, there is a `README.md` file that contains a materials list, procedures on usage, expected results/images, etc. It also contains info on what organism the plasmid is meant for use in.
